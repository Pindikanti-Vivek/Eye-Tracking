# Eye-Tracking

1> Download python (version 3.6) to your computer (refer
https://www.python.org). Ignore if you already have it.

2> Install the opencv , pyautogui , speechrecognition and numpy libraries to you 
computer. A simple way to install libraries is to use “pip install library_name”.

3> Make sure you have two cameras and one mic. One of the cameras should 
be used for screen edge detection so it will face your computer screen, while 
the other one is for tracking your eye.

4> Install the eye cam in such a way that it is close to your eye and has clear
visibility of your pupil.

5> Mic will be used for voice recognition therefore it should be installed in a way 
such that it captures the sound properly.

6> Once installation is complete open Python IDLE application.

7> Copy and paste the code in IDLE.

8> Run the code.

9> Now move your eye and observe the change in cursor position. You can also 
use voice commands like click to perform a click action
